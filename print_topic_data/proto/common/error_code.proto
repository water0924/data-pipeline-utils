//
// Sometimes multiple error codes may apply.  Services should return

  // Deadline expired before operation could complete.  For operations
  // that change the state of the system, this error may be returned

  // to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to
  // a non-directory, etc.
  //
  // A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
  // between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:
  //  (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
  //  (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher-level
  //      (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
  //  (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
  //      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
  //      fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
  //      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
  //      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
  //  (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
  //      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
  //      server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
  //      read-modify-write on the same resource.
  FAILED_PRECONDITION = 9;

  // The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue

  // ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE.
  ABORTED = 10;

  // Operation tried to iterate past the valid input range.  E.g., seeking or
  // reading past end of file.
  //
  // Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may
  // be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
  // system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an
  // offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
  // OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current
  // file size.
  //
  // There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and
  // OUT_OF_RANGE.  We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific
  // error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
  // a space can easily look for an OUT_OF_RANGE error to detect when
  // they are done.
